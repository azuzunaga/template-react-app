# A simple template to get a React app going

To get started, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. All set!

## Why?

I wanted my very own template React app with the settings I love to use.

## How?

I use Parcel as a bundler. Babel, ESLint, and Jest configs are each in their own file. The included CSS file uses system fonts by default and has a pretty simple reset.

The app can be easily extender with Redux, Styled Component, etc.!
